# MarkovChess

## Introduction

A toy exploration of using Markov chains for chess AI. It tends to be effective during openings, but increasingly makes illegal moves as the game progresses. Currently this code will not run, as it was left in a intermediary state during work to incorporate shelving and reduce computation time between runs.
